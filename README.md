# mp3tageditor
A python MP3 tag editor (a learning wxPython project)!

mp3tag.py is the main file.

[ ] Maybe I add a rename files based on title and track no. in the future!

With this app you can open a folder and see the list of MP3 files.  
You can edit some ID3 tags of the selected MP3 file.  
I did this to learn programming GUI python apps.
